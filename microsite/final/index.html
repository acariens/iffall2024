                    Sumikko Gurashi is a set of fictional characters produced by the Japanese company San-X. The name directly translates to "life in the corner". Their main inspiration was the feeling of comfort when one is near a corner, and they were based on Yokomizo's notebook doodles when she was a student. A wealth of merchandise, such as stationery, plush toys, and clothing, is sold. Books,mobile apps, and video games based on the franchise have also been produced. Three animated films with Sumikko Gurashi were released in 2019, 2021, and 2023.
