                <br>
            <li>I am a design major so this class was required. I am also interested in interaction design and learning more about the code 
                behind website builders. </li>
                <br>
            <li>I do not have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS other than a short intro exercise in Typography 1.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I hope to become comfortable manipulating code for typographic design. There is so much a website can do with just a commanding
                composition and careful use of type. </li>
                <br>
            <li>I think the flexibility is something to keep in mind. The way that webpages adapt to screen sizes is obviously different 
                from print.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Maybe it's just my taste but I love how this website https://lanthimos.tilda.ws/ uses unique layout and design with
                typography and images. It spreads the canvas and encourages the user to keep scrolling, breaking away from the "landing page"
                type of feel.</li>
                <br>
            <li>I really like this website https://halodental.com/ because of how it combines modern and minimalist design while still 
                communicating the key parts of the product. It uses great design methods to present information while not overwhelming the user.</li>
                <br>
            <li>I have had this website https://www.chiaraluzzana.com bookmarked for a while now. I love how the visual design of the 
                website supplements the idea of sounds, soundscapes, and creating a sound experience. I love the opening of the site and how it
                reacts to the user's movements. I think it all combines to create a user experience that transports you to a place and feeling.
                I also feel that the typography is simple yet beautiful, giving the whole site texture despite the lack of color. </li>
        </ol>
