        <h2 class="description heading">Description</h2>
            <p class="description intro">Jerk chicken is a spicy, flavorful dish that originated in Jamaica and is popular throughout the Caribbean. It's made by coating meat in a marinade of spices and slow-cooking it over a fire or grill, which gives it a smoky flavor. The main ingredients in the marinade are allspice and Scotch bonnet peppers.</p> <br>

                <li>1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme, crumbled</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li> 
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 (3 1/2 to 4-pound) chickens, quartered</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>In a food processor, combine the onion, scallions, chiles, garlic, five-spice powder, allspice, pepper, thyme, nutmeg, and salt; process to a coarse paste.</p> <br>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>With the machine on, add the soy sauce and oil in a steady stream.</p><br>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Pour the marinade into a large, shallow dish, add the chicken, and turn to coat.</p><br>

            <h2>Sample Websites</h2>
            <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">NYT Cooking</a>
            <p>I have always thought of NYT Cooking as a good recipe website because of it's emphasis on browsing. With an open interface and scrollable options, it encourages users to come to the website without a plan and peruse until they see something they like. Appealing photos, easy to read instructions, and consistency in recipe quality all compliment the intuitive menu bar interface.</p> <br>
            <a href="https://greenkitchenstories.com/recipe-index/">Green Kitchen Stories</a>
            <p>In contrast to many other recipe websites, Green Kitchen Stories is quite minimalist. The entire homepage and interface is very linear. And, the recipe specific page is just one long scrollable page with filter and search options. While I think NYT Cooking focuses on categories to initially split up information, Green Kitchen Stories presents everything in a simple way and lets users decide how they want to narrow their search.</p> <br>
            <a href="https://downshiftology.com/browse-recipes/">Downshiftology</a>
            <p>Downshiftology's recipe page has the option to filter by diet, ingredient, and method. All presented with professional photographs, I just liked the focus on inclusive eating in the search area which adds to an already minimalist and inviting website.</p> <br>

            <h2>Non Recipe Websites</h2>
            <a href="https://www.playground.it/en">Playground.</a>
            <p>I just really like the abnormal placement of text as you scroll to create more movement and fun. I think with linear text like a recipe it might be cool to have some more interesting composition on the site.</p> <br>
            <a href="https://www.cantinadelsol.it/">Catina del Sol</a>
            <p>Stylistically, I think the food images interspersed with the big text is a really nice design touch. It adds depth to the website and sets up a nice hierarchy relationship for the rest of the experience.</p> <br>
            <a href="https://www.oseandive.com/">Osean Dive</a>
            <p>I like this website's emphasis on type and the flat approach to graphics and illustrations. I think it creates a minimal look that allows the user to focus on content. </p> <br>
